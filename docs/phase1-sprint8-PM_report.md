## General questions [25 points]

1. How well did the team meet the requirements of this sprint?
    * We met all the requirements of this sprint effectively, completing all drawings, routes, designs, and planning the structure of our app. We have began implementation but have not achieved any significant functionality. However, we have a solid structure to follow for next week.
    * Ethan updated testing descriptions for backend, and with the help of the team in meetings, executed the drawings of our ERD, FSM, and system architecture diagram. He also updated the routes for new features.
    * Carlos updated testing descriptions for web, and completed the web UI drawings. He also helped plan the ERD and other aspects of planning in our group meetings.
    * Josie updated testing descriptions for admin, and worked on updating user stories. She contributed to the plans in the updated system architecture and FSM drawings as well.
    * Saik updated the test descriptions for mobile, and helped with user stories and test definitions. He helped plan the other general design requirements for this sprint in our group meetings.
1. When is the team gathering for a weekly, in-person meeting(s)? If not, why not?
    1. We met on Thursday night to meet with Hua, and Friday afternoon to further plan requirements with the rest of our team. We will continue this schedule throughout this phase. We also met on Wednesday night this week for initial discussion.
1. Report on each member's progress (phase activity completion) – "what is the status?"
    * Ethan has the structure and planning for backend complete, and has cleaned up the backend code to an extent. There has not been significant implementation, but the plan and structure for this phase is complete.
    * Carlos understands the interactions and structure of web, and plans to complete the transition to react. Functional requirements have not been met, but the plan and structure for this phase is complete.
    * Josie has planned for the changes and added tests that need to be made in admin. Functional requirements have not yet been met, but all planning is complete as per sprint requirements.
    * Saik has examined and understands the current flutter code. He has not yet met functional requirements, but has completed the planning for this phase.
1. Summary of "code review" during which each team member discussed and showed their progress – "how did you confirm the status?"
    * This sprint, we did not do a "code review" per se because there were no functional requirements, but we met three times during this sprint. We discussed the responsibilities and change in structure for each role's requirements during this sprint, such as what new tables are necessary in the ERD and how they can best be implemented.
1. What did you do to encourage the team to be working on phase activities "sooner rather than later"?
    * I added all new requirements to trello on Monday, and on Tuesday we scheduled a meeting for Wednesday night to discuss requirements before our meeting with Hua. Throughout these meetings, we discussed what our responsibilities will be during this role, such as how we will help those who are in our previous roles understand our code. W
1. What did you do to encourage the team to help one another?
    * I encouraged the team to help one another by doing open discussion in meetings, and staying in touch on Slack otherwise. We all worked together to figure out the best way to plan this sprint.
1. How well is the team communicating?
    * Our team is communicating well, with reliable use of slack and consistent meetings. We are generally flexible and able to accommodate each others' schedules.
1. What expectations have you set for one another, if any? Highlight any changes.
    * We have set the expectations to help those now in our previous roles to understand our code base. In particular, I will help Carlos transition to and understand React, and Ethan will help Saik understand mobile. Josie will work with Ethan to understand new admin changes, because admin is somewhat similar to backend. We will all help Ethan with backend to the extent we can, because it appears to be the hardest role this phase.
1. If anything was especially challenging or unclear, please itemize and briefly describe the challenge, its status (resolved or unresolved), and critical steps taken to find resolution.
    * We were somewhat confused about the (lack of) implementation requirements this phase, but discussed it with Hua to understand. Some aspects of new functional requirements were initially unclear, but we were able to figure them out using the phase description.


## Project Management [25 points]
Self-evaluation of PM performance

1. When did your team meet with your mentor, and for how long?
    * We met with Hua on Thursday night for an hour to discuss last sprint and this sprint.
1. Describe your use of Trello.  Did you have too much detail?  Too little?  Just enough? Did you implement policies around its use (if so, what were they?)?
    * I believe we used the right amount of detail on trello. It included all requirements and was an easy way to keep track of what was done, and what still needed done. It also helped define what tasks were each members' responsibility, but was not so much detail to be confusing or excessive.
1. How did you conduct team meetings?  How did your team interact outside of these meetings?
    * We scheduled team meetings by discussing available times during class, and using slack to coordinate them or iron out details. In general, we discussed requirements with a top-down approach, first modifying the system architecture diagram, then the FSM, then the ERD and user stories, and finished with any other specific requirements remaining. We discussed these as a group to encourage a variety of ideas to determine the best approach. Outside of these meetings, we used Slack to communicate.
1. What techniques (daily check-ins/scrums, team programming, timelines, Trello use, group design exercises) did you use to mitigate risk?
    * I made sure to schedule meetings early and check in with teammates on Slack consistently. On Trello, I created checklists when applicable with each person's responsibilities listed, and added owners to cards when applicable. We discussed responsibilites during our first group meeting, and I used slack messaging to ensure everyone remembered to complete their unit test descriptions.
1. Describe any difficulties you faced in managing the interactions among your teammates? Were there any team issues that arose?
    * There were no significant difficulties in managing interactions. We had to reschedule meetings or use Zoom at times, but these were effective solutions.
1. How well did you estimate time during the early part of the phase?  How did your time estimates change as the phase progressed?
    * We estimated time fairly accurately from the start. The FSM and ERD took slightly longer than expected, but since we met early in the week, we were able to complete these and all subsequent requirements with no issues.
1. What aspects of the project would cause concern for your customer right now, if any?
    * As a customer, I would be most concerned about backlog items, and about backend being updated for this phases requirements, as all other roles require backend to be funcitonal. We need to complete our transition to React as well, and deploy the web front end from the backend dokku branch.
1. What is your biggest concern as you think ahead to the next sprint?
    * My biggest concern is whether the backend will be complete, and whether our frontend roles will be able to understand their respective code bases easily, as these can be difficult transitions to understand.
1. Describe the most significant obstacle or difficulty your team faced.
    * The biggest difficulty was making sure everyone could attend meetings, because our schedules are generally conflicting. We were able to solve this with multiple meetings, using slack to communicate, and using Zoom to allow Carlos to attend our Friday meeting.
